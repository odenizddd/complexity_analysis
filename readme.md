This is a Python module that helps you measure how fast different sorting algorithms run. To use it import time_analysis module and call either analyse funtction for a terminal output or visualize function for a graphic output with two parameters. The first parameter is a Python dictionary that has algorithm names as keys and the actual functions that sort arrays as values. The sorting functions should only take one parameter that is the array to be sorted.

When those to parameters are passed to either analyse or visualize function, they run each sorting algorithm in the dictionary with all the input sizes in the second parameter and either print it to stdout or use matplotlib to visualize it. The test.py shows how to use visualize function with the appropriate parameters.
